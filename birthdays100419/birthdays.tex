\begin{problem}
The classic birthday problem asks about how many people need to be in a room together before you have 
better-than-even odds that at least two of them have the same birthday. Ignoring leap years, the answer is, 
paradoxically, only 23 people â€” fewer than you might intuitively think.

But Joel noticed something interesting about a well-known group of 100 people: In the U.S. Senate, three senators 
happen to share the same birthday of October 20: Kamala Harris, Brian Schatz and Sheldon Whitehouse.

And so Joel has thrown a new wrinkle into the classic birthday problem. How many people do you need to have 
better-than-even odds that at least three of them have the same birthday? (Again, ignore leap years.)
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
The probability that any $k$ people have the same birthday is, ignoring leap years, $\left(\frac{1}{365}\right)^{(k-1)}$,
because the first person will have some birthday, and then we want the probability that the other $k-1$ people were all
born on that specific day. The probability that, in a room of $n$ people, $k$ of them have the same birthday, is
equivalent to 1 minus the probability that no group of $k$ people have the same birthday. That probability is
$1-\left(\frac{1}{365}\right)^{(k-1)}$ raised to the power of the number of possible groups of $k$ people, or
${n \choose k}$. Thus, the probability of $k$ people sharing a birthday in a room of $n$ people is
$$1- \left(1-\left(\frac{1}{365}\right)^{(k-1)}\right)^{n \choose k}.$$
In the case where $k = 3$, this becomes
$$1- \left(1-\left(\frac{1}{365}\right)^{(2)}\right)^{n \choose 3}.$$
If we set this equal to $.5$ and solve for $n$, we get 83.1375, meaning we need at least 84 people in a room before we
get better than even odds that 3 of them share a birthday. We can also use the equation above to see that in any given
US Senate, the odds of three Senators sharing a birthday are 70.29\%.
